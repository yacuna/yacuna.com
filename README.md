# Non-Gratification Github Issue Tracker

Welcome to our Github Issue Tracker. Here you can quickly report low-severity bugs. In contrast to our Bounty Program you will earn **no** monetary reward this way. Still you are helping out our exchange and therefore the cryptocommunity as a whole. So it's for a good cause!

# YACUNA BOUNTY PROGRAM

Bugs! We know they crawl around somewhere. Usually, they mean no harm and we’re delighted to see them as they can turn out to become real features. However, some bugs might interfere with the original concept of a secure and safeguarded environment for our customers to trade Bitcoins & other cryptocurrencies.

Although our experts are continuously patrolling the systems for bugs, there’s always the chance that we might have missed one bug. In order to prevent the bugs from becoming a significant vulnerability, we encourage our users to report potential bugs directly to us. We really appreciate your help by responsibly reporting the bugs to us in order to fix them as soon as possible.

If you want to start hunting for bugs, please be responsible while investigating our services. We will investigate all legitimate reports and do our best to quickly fix the problem. Before reporting though, please review this page including our responsible disclosure policy, reward guidelines, and those things that should not be reported.

If you do not want to report a bug, but believe your account has been compromised or if you cannot access your account, read our FAQ and contact our support. If you are looking to report another type of issue, please visit our FAQ and Help Center for assistance.

## RESPONSIBLE DISCLOSURE POLICY

We ask you to give us reasonable time to respond to your report before making any information public. If you make a good faith effort to avoid privacy violations, destruction of data, and interruption or degradation of our service during your research, we will not bring any lawsuit against you or ask law enforcement to investigate you.

To participate in the Yacuna Bounty Program, you must follow the above mentioned requirements and the following set of rules. Otherwise your actions might be interpreted as an attack on our systems.

* Do not violate the privacy of other users, destroy data, disrupt our services, etc.
* Only target your own accounts and do not target, attempt to access, or otherwise disrupt the accounts of other users.
* Do not attempt to use social or reverse engineering, do not spam our systems, do not distribute a denial of service (DDOS) attack and do not attack our physical security measures, etc.
* Initially report the bug only to us and not to anyone else. Spreading a bug to the community does not help anyone.
* Give us a reasonable amount of time to fix the bug before disclosing it to anyone else, and give us adequate written warning before disclosing it to anyone else.

## YACUNA BOUNTY PROGRAM INFO

To show our appreciation for our security researchers, we offer a monetary bounty for certain qualifying security bugs. Generally speaking, any bug that poses a significant vulnerability, either to the security of our site or the integrity of our trading system, could be eligible for reward. But it’s entirely at our discretion to decide whether a bug is significant enough to be eligible for reward.

## ELIGIBILITY

To qualify for a bounty, you must:

* Adhere to our Responsible Disclosure Policy
* Be the first person to responsibly disclose the bug
* Report a bug that could compromise the integrity of user data, circumvent the privacy protections of user data, or enable access to a system within our infrastructure, such as:
  1. Cross-Site Scripting (XSS)
  2. Cross-Site Request Forgery (CSRF/XSRF)
  3. Code Injection
  4. Remote Code Execution
  5. Privilege Escalation
  6. Clickjacking
  7. Provisioning Errors
  8. Leakage of Sensitive Data
  9. Authentication Bypass
  10. Broken Authentication (including Facebook OAuth bugs)
  11. Circumvention of our platform/privacy permission models
* Report a bug in Yacuna, Yacuna Direct or Yacuna Developer API.
* Make every effort to use a test account instead of a real account when investigating bugs. When you are unable to reproduce a bug with a test account, it is acceptable to use a real account, except for automated testing.
* Not interact with other accounts without the consent of their owners.
* Not reside in a country under any current UK and EU Sanctions.

## BOUNTIES

* Bounties are awarded at the discretion of the bug bounty team:
* Our minimum reward is 10 Euro
* There is no maximum reward: each bug is awarded a bounty based on its severity and creativity. See the Yacuna Bounty Program page for examples of real issues and the bounties we’ve paid.
* Only one bounty per security bug will be awarded
* If you choose to donate to a recognized charity we will match your bounty so that the charity gets double the bounty amount!
* We of course, reserve the right to refuse any application.

## ATTRIBUTES OF A GOOD REPORT

* Include your name and link as you would like it to appear on our Wall of Fame (optional).
* Include your XBT address for payment.
* Please allow two business days for us to respond before sending another email.
* Detailed steps in your message explaining how to reproduce the bug. This should include any links you clicked on, pages you visited, URLs, user IDs, etc. Screenshots, images and video can be helpful if you also include written explanations, including a description of the bug, its potential impact, and steps for reproducing it or proof of concept.
* Clear descriptions of any accounts used in your report and the relationships between them. Please do not use the same name on multiple accounts to avoid confusion.
* Quality before quantity. Many of our highest-paid reports had just a few lines of precise, clear explanations.
* If you send a video, consider these tips:
  1. Keep it short by showing only the parts necessary to demonstrate the bug once.
  2. Remove or redo mistakes that might happen while recording.
  3. Record at a resolution where text or URLs are readable, at least 480p; (1080p is usually not necessary).
  4. Provide commentary or instructions in your messages or video description instead of typing on-screen during the video.
  5. Setting Yacuna to English while recording steps helps us quickly identify what features you use.
  6. If a large amount of text appears in your video, please include a copy in your messages as well.
  7. Keep the video private either by uploading it as an attachment or posting it privately online (such as with a hidden link or password that you send to us).
* Send your detailed bug report to bounty@yacuna.com.

## INELIGIBLE REPORTS AND FALSE POSITIVES

* Open redirects.
* Spam or social engineering techniques.
* Physical attacks.
* Denial-of-service attacks (DDOS).
* Case-insensitive passwords.
* Content injection (also “content spoofing” or “HTML injection”) is ineligible unless you can clearly demonstrate a significant risk.
* Security issues in third-party apps or websites that integrate with Yacuna. These are not managed by Yacuna and do not qualify under our guidelines for security testing.
* Vulnerabilities affecting outdated or unpatched browsers.
* Vulnerabilities in third party applications that make use of Yacuna’s Developer API.
* Bugs that have not been responsibly investigated and reported.
* Bugs already known to us, or already reported by someone else (reward goes to first reporter).
* Issues that aren’t reproducible.
* Issues that we can’t reasonably be expected to do anything about.
